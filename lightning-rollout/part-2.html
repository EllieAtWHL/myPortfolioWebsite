                    <h4>This is the second in my series to help you manage the completion of your Lighting roll-out successfully. I am currently working on my third roll-out of Lightning and so am sharing some of my learnings to help ensure yours goes smoothly. Everything I speak about below are things that have worked for me, however, that doesn’t mean it is the only way to do it. As with most things Salesforce, there are multiple ways of doing things, these are the way I found to be successful.</h4>

                    <h2>Roll Out Phase</h2>

                    <h3>How do I manage the project of migrating over to Lightning?</h3>
                    <p>To start your project, you will need to determine to things, your rollout strategy and the scope of work covered by it.</p>

                    <h4>Rollout Strategy</h4>
                    <p>There are a variety of rollout strategies that can be used and what you decide upon will depend on the size and complexity of your Salesforce instance. The main two strategies are to roll out in groups of users (for example, either one team at a time, or one person from within each team) or a big bang approach of rolling it out to all users at once. I would highly recommend not considering the latter. My main reasoning is that even if you have managed to as much research as possible into how the different areas of the business use Salesforce, there's almost always something somewhere that has been overlooked and the reputational risk of Lightning when this is discovered could lead to poor user adoption. If you move over teams at a time, you can ensure that it is working perfectly for one team before moving onto the next — and you can also learn from each iteration. The later teams should be quicker to roll out, as a lot of the changes will already have been made.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Scope of Rollout</h4>
                    <p>When considering the scope of work for the project, the primary objective might be to ensure that all existing functionality remains available in Lightning. However, it may be from your research that you have identified inefficient processes, so it may be decided to make improvements to those as part of the rollout. Whatever the decisions are made, you need to ensure the business is clear what the scope is to avoid disappointment and potentially damaging the reputation of Lightning.</p>
