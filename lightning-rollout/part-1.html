                    <h1>How To Persuade Your Business To Let Lightning Strike</h1>
                    <p>This is the first in my series to help you complete your Lighting roll-out successfully. I am currently working on my third roll-out of Lightning and so am sharing some of my learnings to help ensure yours goes smoothly. Everything I speak about below are things that have worked for me, however, that doesn’t mean it is the only way to do it. As with most things Salesforce, there are multiple ways of doing things, these are the way I found to be successful.</p>
                    <h2>Discovery Phase</h2>
                    <h3>How do you get approval from the business that they should migrate to Salesforce Lightning?</h3>
                    <p>Depending on the type of company you work for, you may need to get approval to start a project to migrate your Salesforce instance to Lightning, and this is may not be as easy as it sounds. Below are the steps I took to get approval.</p>
                    <h4>Level Up</h4>
                    <p>Before I took my suggestion to the business, I ensured I fully understood the implications and benefits myself. There are several ways I did this.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lightning Readiness Report</li>
                        <img src="../img/lightningReadinessReport.gif">
                        <li>Trailhead</li>
                        <li>Enablement Pack</li>
                        <li>Your org, your decision</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Understand your business</h4>
                    <p>
                        If you don’t already understand the ins and outs of your business and how they use Salesforce, then now is the time to do so. You need to understand what drives your business to ensure that you pull at the right levers to persuade them that Lightning is the right fit for them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For Sales teams, you should consider understanding how and why do they make money? How can you use this to show an improved ROI (return on investment)? Can you improve the efficiency of producing required documents for the sales process, for example?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For Service teams, understand how they currently manage their cases and communicate with the people they are “servicing”. Find out how they escalate cases or find out answers they don’t already know the answer too. You may be able to use some of the Lightning functionality to improve their efficiency at resolving the more complex cases — as well as automating more on the simple cases.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Speak to both end-users and the decision-makers to understand existing pain points, defunct processes, and must-have functionality. Often some of these existing pain points could have been solved in Classic if you had just known about them. Use this to your advantage as quick wins in the transition to Lightning and help with end-user buy-in.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Personalise your presentation</h4>
                    <p>
                        Chances are at some point, you will have to provide a presentation about why you should move to Lightning. Don’t fall into the trap of using the template presentation provided in the Enablement Pack. This deck is a great starting point, but it needs to be personalised to your business.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ensure that you brand your presentation deck using your company’s brand guidelines. You may be working on the Salesforce application, but you are doing it for your company and that is what needs to be at the heart of this transformation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Remove slides/sections of the template that cover functionality not currently in use. For example, if you don’t use Chatter, then delete all references to it, rather than confusing your audiences. Pick out the highlights that affect your business and use them as the building blocks for your presentation.
