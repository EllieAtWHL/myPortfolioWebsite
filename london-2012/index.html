                            As a lifelong fan of sports and performance, the opportunity to volunteer as a performer at the London 2012 Olympics was a dream come true. As part of the team of volunteer performers, I had the chance to be a part of one of the biggest and most exciting events in the world.

                            My role as a volunteer performer at the London 2012 Olympics involved rehearsing and performing in both the opening and closing ceremonies.

                            One of the most memorable moments of my experience as a volunteer performer at the London 2012 Olympics was the opportunity to perform in front of a global audience during the opening ceremony.
