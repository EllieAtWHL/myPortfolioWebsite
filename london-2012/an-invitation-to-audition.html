    One month after submitting my application, I received an invitation to audition for the Olympic Ceremonies. However, when I attempted to provide the required identification details, I encountered an issue. The organizers needed me to provide a reference number from my birth certificate, passport, or driver's license, but my birth certificate was currently being processed at the home office in order to obtain a passport for my honeymoon, and I don't have a driver's license. I contacted the organizers to explain my situation, and a helpful representative assured me that they would call me back in a few days with a solution.

    Fortunately, my birth certificate was returned to me in the interim, allowing me to schedule my first audition for Friday, November 4th, just eight days after my wedding. The casting team called me back to confirm the details and gather additional information, and I was all set to go.
