                        <h2>An Invitation to Audition</h2>
                        <p>I had almost forggoten I had applied, when out of nowhere, I received my invitation to audition for the Olympic Ceremonies, a one month after submitting my application. Anything worth anything, often has roadblocks in the way and it was as I completed the required details to allow me to book my audition, I encountered my first roadbloack. I was required to provide a reference number from my birth certificate, passport, or driver's license. Sounds simple enough, except my birth certificate was currently being processed at the home office in order to obtain a passport for my  upcoming honeymoon, so no access to my birth certificate or passport, and unusual, I know, but I don't drive, so don't have a driver's licence. I refused to let this minor setback defeat me. I reached out to the organisers, explaining my predicament and was met with a ray of hope. A kind representative assured me that they would find a solution and get back to me in a few days.</p>

                            The stars aligned in my favor as my birth certificate, the missing puzzle piece, was returned to me in the interim, allowing me to complete my identification process and book my first audition. Friday, November 4th - just eight days after my wedding. The casting team duly called back, as promised, and all details were confirmed. Everything was in place for me begin my journey, and even if it was to end at the first stage, I was so excited to just be part of it.
