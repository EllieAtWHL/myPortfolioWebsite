    LOCOG (the London Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games) released a press release announcing that they were seeking volunteer performers for the London 2012 Olympic Ceremonies. Initially, I was hesitant to apply, despite posting on Facebook how I was tempted to apply, but after some contemplation, I decided that it couldn't hurt to try. I completed the application, but to be honest, I didn't believe that I had much of a chance of being selected. However, I knew that the Olympics would be a significant part of my life regardless of where I was in the summer of 2012, so I figured it was worth a shot.
