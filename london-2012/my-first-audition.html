    4th November 2011

        Audition day finally arrived, and although I had originally intended to keep it a secret, I eventually confided in a few members of my family. I didn't want to have to face the potential disappointment of this being the end of a dream in front of too many people. The audition was held at 3 Mills Studio, which was conveniently located near the Bromley-By-Bow tube station and easy for me to access.

        As is typical for me, I arrived early and found myself relatively near the front of the queue. My number for the first audition was 061, which I took as a good omen since that was the year my favorite football team, Spurs, won the double. There appeared to be around 200 people in each of the three simultaneous auditions. At the beginning of the audition, we were introduced to Steve Boyd, the Director of Mass Movement, who had been involved in numerous Olympic and Commonwealth ceremonies. Little did I know at the time how much I would hear his voice over the coming months.

        The audition itself was divided into three parts, starting with basic movement and gradually becoming more complex. As a former dancer, I found the movements to be manageable. One of the main pieces of music used during the audition was Beyonce's "Love On Top," which will now always remind me of this day. Overall, it was a lot of fun, and I felt like I was already a part of the London 2012 experience, even if this was the end of my journey. We were told that we would receive a response within 48 hours, so I found myself attached to my phone, eagerly awaiting an email.
