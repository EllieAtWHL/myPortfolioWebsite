    16th January 2012

    It was a typical Monday morning at work, and things were moving slowly as I headed out for lunch. As I walked out of the office, I saw that the email I had been eagerly awaiting for the past two weeks had finally arrived. It had been a day over 8 weeks since my second audition, and I couldn't help but feel anxious as I opened the email. However, the subject line immediately put me at ease.

    The first thing I did was call my husband to share the news, followed immediately by a call to my mum. I remember her asking me questions about the role, and me trying to explain to her that I had told her everything I knew!

After my lunch break, I returned to work and faced the task of telling my boss the news and hoping that the time off I would require wouldn't be a problem. As I work in a different office from my manager, I decided to email her rather than call, where others might overhear. I was incredibly nervous, as I had only been working there for a little over a month and wasn't sure how they would react. However, I needn't have worried, as I immediately received a phone call congratulating me and offering all the support they could provide.

The news didn't take long to spread to the other department managers, and I am truly grateful for their supportive reactions.

When I got home that night, I was buzzing with excitement. I immediately clicked the link to accept my position, signed my performer agreement and confidentiality agreement, scanned and emailed them to the cast coordinators, along with a query asking them to confirm that I would be participating in both the Opening and Closing ceremonies.

Next, it was time to share the news with others. I emailed my sister in the United States, posted the news on both Twitter and Facebook, and began searching online to see if I could find out any more information about the ceremonies.

As I searched online, I stumbled upon a thread in a forum called "The Student Room" (https://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/showthread.php?t=1781019&page=24&page=24) about auditions and cast offers. As I began reading it, I had no idea how valuable this source of information would become. Although I rarely posted, I read it every day, following all of the posters' ups and downs, and found it a great way to get to know some of my fellow marshals before rehearsals began.

For the next week, I found it difficult to sleep as I daydreamed about what the future held. This was a dream I hadn't even dared to dream, and although rehearsals weren't set to start for another four months, it would soon become a reality.
