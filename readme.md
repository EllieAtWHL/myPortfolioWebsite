## Regicide

Includes my digitised version of the Regicide Card Game

Regicide is a challenging, card game based on a standard 52 card deck.

Kickstarted by [Badgers From Mars](https://www.badgersfrommars.com/) in May 2020.

You can [buy your own copy](https://www.badgersfrommars.com/buy-regicide/) or [learn to play](https://www.badgersfrommars.com/regicide/). I hope you learn to love it as much as I do!

### Improvement List

- Make more mobile-friendly
- Include a way of teaching new players how to play
- Option to restart (with same starting cards)
